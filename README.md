# Stor3: Your identity on blockchain!
The ChainKey blockchain solution offers secure data storage and proof of record for personal and business use. ChainKey can be used for anything from horse passports, EHRs and GDPR compliant storage of personal data. When you upload a document to ChainKey, it creates a permanent traceable record which cannot be lost, hacked or tampered with. The document is recorded on a public or private blockchain and only you or a nominated trusted party has access and can prove ownership. The data is easily retrievable and can be shared with whoever you choose. ChainKey can be white labelled or reconfigured for private permissioned blockchains.
Our white paper is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qDkc8HgRII0tXEMjO4vINPavd7rhRn-_MIJ0k5BOsdc/edit?ts=5ca4bc70#).
## How Stor3 works?
Chain key works as a mobile app and enables user to hash their personal documents and store minimal to blockchain. Please refer to ChainKey [wiki](https://github.com/GrandeoLabs/chainkey/wiki) for details.
